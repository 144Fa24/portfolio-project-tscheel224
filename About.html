        <div id="about">
        
            <p>I’m an undergraduate student at Northwest Missouri State University, 
                pursuing a major in professional writing with a minor
                in digital media. My journey combines a love for creative 
                storytelling and a passion for technical communication. I thrive 
                on crafting engaging narratives that resonate with readers, whether 
                through fiction, poetry, or clear technical documentation. Alongside my writing, 
                I have a strong design background, creating everything from websites to book covers
                and promotional materials. I believe that effective communication blends compelling 
                content with striking visuals, and I’m excited to explore new opportunities that challenge 
                and inspire me as I develop my skills in this dynamic field.</p>
