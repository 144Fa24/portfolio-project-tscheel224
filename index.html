        <h4>Hello!</h4>
        <p>I am a Professional Writing Major with a Minor in Digital Media. I have a passion 
            for weaving together creative stories, as well as technical writing. With a keen eye for design, 
            I’ve crafted everything from websites and book covers to brochures and flyers. My work 
            bridges the gap between compelling narratives and stunning visuals, ensuring that every 
            project not only informs but also inspires. Explore my projects to see how I bring ideas 
            to life through words and design!
